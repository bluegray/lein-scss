# lein-scss

A Leiningen plugin to compile scss to css.

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/lein-scss/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/lein-scss)

## Usage

Put `[lein-scss "0.1.3"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.

Run with:

    lein scss <build-keys ...> [once|auto]

- The `auto` option watches the source directory for changes and automatically compiles them.
- The `once` option will compile all stylesheets and exit.
- Running without these options will compile all stylesheets in the source directory and then wait for changes.
- `build-keys` can be one or more keywords for builds specified in the *project.clj* configuration, see below.

## Setup

An example project.clj would look like this:
```clojure
(defproject myproject "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "My Project"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.6.0"]]
  :plugins      [[lein-scss "0.1.3"]]

  :scss {:builds
         {:develop    {:source-dir "scss/"
                       :dest-dir   "public/css/"
                       :executable "sassc"
                       :args       ["-m" "-I" "scss/" "-t" "nested"]}
          :production {:source-dir "scss/"
                       :dest-dir   "public/css/"
                       :executable "sassc"
                       :args       ["-I" "scss/" "-t" "compressed"]}
          :test       {:source-dir "tests/scss/"
                       :dest-dir   "/tmp/test/css/"
                       :executable "sassc"
                       :args       ["-m" "-I" "scss/" "-t" "nested"]}}}
```

* `:source-dir` is the directory containing your `.scss` source files.
* `:dest-dir` is the directory where `.css` files will be generated.
* `:executable` is the path to your sass conversion binary.
* `:args` is a vector of arguments to add to the command.
